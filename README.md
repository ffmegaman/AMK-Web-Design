AMK-Web-Design
==============

We are a consulting firm that offers the following services: SEO, Website Design and Logo Design.  The company wants a website to generate new business and capture the contact information for potential clients (for future engagement). With the conversion of potential customers from the website the firm will generate immediate revenue and a potential stream of future revenue. This will also serve as a platform for re-engagement for active and non-active customers.

Object Modeling:
-We started with two different ways of planning object model.  The first model was a flow chart of the customer class interaction utilizing field sets.  The second model was on a higher level planning our class and the instances of those classes (our objects)
-used pen and paper to draw our object model (approved by Book)
-our customer class would have the properties of: name and email
-our products class would include three objects: SEO, logo design and website design

  Structure of the website:
-comprised of three pages (Home, About, and Contact) - we utilized the anchor tags to provide the navigation between the different pages.
-the contact form is located on the contact page where the user is able to input their contact informtion for future coresspondance (currently this information is not stored anywhere).  To execute this functionality we utilized Javascript to ensure the user provides an email and user name longer than one letter. In the event that user does not input an email or user name to our criteria they are prompted to do so.

  Collabrators:
  -Brook and Ryan helped us with our object modeling
  -Dexter helped us troubleshoot a github issue
  -w3schools.com (was utilized to troubleshoot problems), stackoverlow.com, and anotheruiguy.com (for help with OOCSS and SMACSS)
  -both class books
  -google to find images for: business stock photos, twitter icons and facebook icons.

Challenges:
Our biggest challenges were the SMACSS requirements and making sure that were following correct naming conventions and styling.  We also learned that the Module CSS style sheet needed to be untilzed for styling of all the smaller component parts.  We also solved for the redundancy of classes we created by formatting by element. This indicates that we should have further planned the layout before starting to code. We thought we had done enough planning but in hindsight we had not.
